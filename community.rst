**********************
The *pandas* community
**********************

In 2008, *pandas* development began at `AQR Capital Management <http://www.aqr.com>`_. By the end of 2009 it had been `open sourced <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>`_, and is actively maintained today by `Lambda Foundry <http://www.lambdafoundry.com>`_, a company focused on building high-performance and high-productivity tools for Finance. Please see the `commercial support <commercialsupport.html>`_ page for full details.

There is also a community of like-minded individuals around the world who contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source *pandas* possible. Thank you to `all of our contributors <https://github.com/wesm/pandas/contributors>`_.
