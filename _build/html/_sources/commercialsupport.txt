In 2008, *pandas* development began at `AQR Capital Management <http://www.aqr.com>`_. By the end of 2009, AQR was kind enough to open source the development. They remain heavy users of the *pandas* library in their mission-critical production infrastructure, and continue to contribute reports of any issues they encounter.
